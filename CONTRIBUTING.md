## üíª Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent fixes for production

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Ensure you're on develop and up to date
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. **Write your code** following our coding standards
2. **Write/update tests** for your changes
3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd pet-store-api
   mvn test

   # Frontend tests
   cd pet-store-frontend
   npm test
   ```
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Commit your changes** following commit guidelines

## üìê Coding Standards

### Backend (Java/Spring Boot)

#### Code Style
- Follow **Google Java Style Guide**
- Use **4 spaces** for indentation
- Maximum line length: **120 characters**
- Use **meaningful variable and method names**

#### Best Practices
- Follow **SOLID principles**
- Use **dependency injection** (constructor injection preferred)
- Write **self-documenting code** with clear names
- Add **JavaDoc** for public methods and classes
- Use **@Override** annotation when applicable
- Handle exceptions properly, don't catch generic Exception

#### Example:
```java
@Service
public class PetService {
    private final PetRepository petRepository;
    private final CategoryRepository categoryRepository;

    /**
     * Constructs a PetService with required dependencies.
     *
     * @param petRepository the repository for pet operations
     * @param categoryRepository the repository for category operations
     */
    public PetService(PetRepository petRepository, 
                      CategoryRepository categoryRepository) {
        this.petRepository = petRepository;
        this.categoryRepository = categoryRepository;
    }

    /**
     * Creates a new pet in the system.
     *
     * @param petRequest the pet creation request
     * @return the created pet
     * @throws CategoryNotFoundException if the category doesn't exist
     */
    public Pet createPet(PetRequest petRequest) {
        Category category = categoryRepository.findById(petRequest.getCategoryId())
            .orElseThrow(() -> new CategoryNotFoundException(
                "Category not found with id: " + petRequest.getCategoryId()));
        
        Pet pet = new Pet();
        pet.setName(petRequest.getName());
        pet.setCategory(category);
        
        return petRepository.save(pet);
    }
}
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/Angular)

#### Code Style
- Follow **Angular Style Guide**
- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Maximum line length: **120 characters**
- Use **camelCase** for variables and methods
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and interfaces

#### Best Practices
- Use **standalone components** (Angular 17+)
- Implement **OnDestroy** and unsubscribe from observables
- Use **async pipe** where possible
- Use **TypeScript strict mode**
- Use **interfaces** for type safety
- Follow **single responsibility principle**

#### Example:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-pet-list',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, MatCardModule, MatButtonModule],
  templateUrl: './pet-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./pet-list.component.scss']
})
export class PetListComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  pets$: Observable<Pet[]>;
  private destroy$ = new Subject<void>();

  constructor(private petService: PetService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.loadPets();
  }

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }

  private loadPets(): void {
    this.pets$ = this.petService.getAllPets().pipe(
      takeUntil(this.destroy$),
      catchError(error => {
        console.error('Error loading pets:', error);
        return of([]);
      })
    );
  }
}
```

### Database

- Use **meaningful table and column names**
- Follow **snake_case** naming convention
- Add **indexes** for frequently queried columns
- Use **foreign key constraints**
- Add **database comments** for clarity
